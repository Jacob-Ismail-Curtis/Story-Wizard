# StoryWizard

## The Goal
Reading at a young age can help children learn and develop in many ways, such as improving literacy skills or “sparking the imagination”. However, nowadays many parents are expected to buy and store numerous picture books to entertain their children which can be costly. Moreover, children may get bored with the same books and parents will need to buy new ones to keep children interested. StoryWizard aims to save parents time by automating the process of obtaining children’s stories, whilst alleviating the financial burden of having to repeatedly buy and store children’s books.


StoryWizard’s AI quickly generates unique, imaginative picture books with the help of the user’s inputs. All the stories are stored online and saved for the users to read later. Since the AI receives inputs from the user it can create these stories bespoke to their interests, whether it be dragons, pirates or aliens. It learns from the user through a feedback system, which is an easy-to-use “like/dislike” system. With this feedback, the AI knows whether the stories it creates are good or bad and can adjust and personalise its approach.

## Disclaimer

StoryWizard is only a prototype 'concept' app. Only the front-end code has been built and the actual AI has not yet been developed. This app was built in a team with the help of Robbie Goodall, Guy Roberts, Chris Stuttard, Jack Rathbone, Jordan Saphir, Dan Champion and Jeffrey Gugelmann.
